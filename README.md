# developer-profile-generator

Available on a console, this developer profile generator is designed for developers with GitHub profiles. When prompted for their GitHub username and favorite color, a PDF profile is generated with the favorite color as a background.

Using Node.JS, the GitHub API, and Google Maps, the generated profile includes the developer's username at the very top, the bio image and text from the developer's from his/her GitHub profile. It also includes the user's location (linked to Google Maps), as well the following stats:

* number of public repositories
* number of followers
* number following
* number of GitHub stars (using the GitHub repo API)
