# developer-profile-generator

Available on a console, this developer profile generator is designed for developers with GitHub profiles. When prompted for their GitHub username and favorite color, a PDF profile is generated with the favorite color as a background.

Using Node.JS, the GitHub API, and Google Maps, the generated profile includes the developer's username at the very top, the bio image from the developer's GitHub profile, and the link to said profile. It also includes the user's location (linked to Google Maps), and the user's bio. The following stats are also included:

* number of public repositories
* number of followers
* number followed by
* number of GitHub stars (using the GitHub repo API)
